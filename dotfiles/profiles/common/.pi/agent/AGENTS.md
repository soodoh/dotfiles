# Global working preferences

## Commit metadata
- When making commits, never include any `Co-authored-by` trailers.

## Coding Guidelines

- Do not manually cast types, this indicates we need better typing holistically.
- Do not add lint or TypeScript suppression comments.
- Do not use default React imports; use named imports such as `import { useState } from "react"`.
- Prefer extending or refactoring existing shared code before adding new abstractions.
- Do not introduce parallel implementations when an existing shared pattern or utility can be reused.
